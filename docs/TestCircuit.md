# Dummy Meter

This document shows how to make a circuit with an easily adjustable LED flashing rate. This is useful for testing your meter reader circuit without having to use an acutal smart meter. A second Arduino is required to run the dummy meter.


## Bill of Materials

* (1) Arduino
* (1) [10K linear potentiometer](https://www.adafruit.com/products/562)
* (1) LED, any colour
* (1) 220Î© resistor
